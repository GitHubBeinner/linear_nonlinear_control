# linear_nonlinear_control
Implementing the linear and nonlinear control theories.
For an instance, model predictive control, nonlinear model predictive control, sliding mode control etc

Now you can see the examples of control theories as following

- **Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR)**
- **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with CGMRES**
- **Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC)**(as generic function such as matlab tool box)
- **Extended Linear Model Predictive Control for vehicle model**

# Usage and Details

# Basic Requirement

- python3.5 or more
- numpy
- matplotlib
